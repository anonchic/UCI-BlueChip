# UCI-BlueChip

Note that you will need <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">Java</a> to compile and run many of the programs in this repo and <a href="https://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads">JavaCC 5</a> to re-build the VHDL parser that is used for UCI analysis.

# Malicious hardware footholds for software exploitation

AttackFiles
  Source code for each of the three attacks.
  Leon3 designs with each attack and corresponding bit files.
  Results of UCI analysis for each attack.
  New design files with hardware monitors for each pair remaining after UCI analysis.

# UCI Analysis

VHDLParser
  UCI analysis program.

VHDLUtils
  Support classes used by the UCI program.
  
VHDLExpressionEval
  Copy of external java library for evaluating complex expressions.
  
# Post UCI Analysis

pair_remover
  Program that removes code from a VHDL file based upon pairs that remain after UCI analysis.

Visuals
  Contains visualizations of the Leon3 and highlighting based-upon UCI analysis.
  
Highlighter
  Contains a program to highlight nodes in a graph given UCI analysis.

# BlueChip

PairsToVHDL
  Program that creates run-time hardware monitors that trigger BlueChip for the pairs that remain after UCI analysis.
  
BlueChip
  BlueChip SPARC-v8 instruction set simulator to be run as a Linux Kernel driver.

snapgear_linux
  Linux that runs on the Leon3 SoC.
  
benchmarks
  Programs used to check for the software run-time overhead due to false activations of BlueChip.
