Put input file in some canonical form
Assign values to generics and constants
	Either user specified or use default values
	A final version of the program would go top down (system module wise), tracking and assigning correct values to all generics and constants
Replace conditional blocks that have a constant result
	if-elsif-else
	when-else
	switch
Remove signals that aren't used in a conditional statement of as the LHS of an assignment
Unroll/replace for/if generate statements
Unroll loops
Replace implicit null statements with explicit nulls

De-obfuscate the file
	Correct indentation
	Always use block opening and closing constructs
	One statement per line
	Remove excessive white-space

Output the resulting file
	No generics
	No constants
	No generate statements
	No loops
	No constant conditionals
	No clearly unused signals
	No stacked statements
	Clear structure

Show how elaboration significantly increases code coverage results
Generate control/data flow graph of the file
Given a set of signals that don't affect output, remove all code that now becomes useless
	Show that this doesn't affect simulation output
