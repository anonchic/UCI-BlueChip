Solid lines represent dataflow lines that allow data to pass between nodes

Dotted lines represent control flow lines that activate or deactivate
signal assignments

Point nodes represent a combination of like-named signals (only one
can exist at a global level), where only one incident dataflow line is
active at any time
       The simulator must pass the value of the most recent input line
       to toggle to the output

Oval nodes represent combinational operations

Rectangle nodes labeled "reg" represent flip-flops

Subdivided rectangle nodes represent control structures

Trapezoids represent terminals for input and output signal information
